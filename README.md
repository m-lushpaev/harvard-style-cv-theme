## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Blank or Empty Page with Remote Theme

If you use this theme as a `remote_theme` and see a blank or empty page (no HTML output), check the following:

1. **Add an `index.md` file**
   - Your test repo must have an `index.md` (or `index.html`) file with at least:
     ```markdown
     ---
     layout: cv
     title: CV
     ---
     ```
2. **Check `_config.yml`**
   - It should contain:
     ```yaml
     remote_theme: smirnoffmg/harvard-style-cv-theme
     ```
   - Do **not** include a `theme:` line.
3. **Provide `_data/cv.yml`**
   - Make sure your repo has a valid `_data/cv.yml` file with at least one section and entry.
4. **Ensure valid front matter**
   - All content files (like `index.md`) must start with `---` (YAML front matter).
5. **Theme repository is public**
   - The theme repo must be public for GitHub Pages to access it.
6. **No custom plugins**
   - Only use plugins supported by GitHub Pages.
7. **Check GitHub Pages build logs**
   - If the page is still blank, check the Pages build log (Actions tab or Pages status) for errors.
8. **Wait for propagation**
   - Sometimes, changes take a few minutes to appear.

### Minimal Test Repo Structure

```
_config.yml
_data/
  cv.yml
index.md
```

If you still see a blank page, double-check the above and consult the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/troubleshooting-github-pages-sites) for more help.
